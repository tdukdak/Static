        I enjoy the Met the most out of the 3 spots as I like to listen to music and walk around looking at all the artwork

      <p>5th Ave is good depending on the day but its super pricy and it gets crowded sometimes. Domino Park is only this high on enjoyment because it holds many nice memories of me and my cousins</p>
